/*
  INSTRUCTIONS

  Write a function that takes an array of strings (food items)
  and adds them to the fridge.

  Requirements:
    - You will need to find the fridge
    - You'll need to iterate over the food items with a loop or array method
    - You'll need to add a class of fridge__item to the food so it displays properly
    - Don't forget to run the function
*/
function fillTheFridge(foodList) {
  // ...
}

// Run it!



/*
  BONUS: 
    Add both food items to the fridge by combining both food arrays 
    (and calling the function only once!)
 */
